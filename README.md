# harponica
HarpJS had issues that prevented it from being bundled with an Electron app. Namely, this was that its node-sass dependency which prevented it from being effectively used cross-platform. As a result, Harponica was created to serve the sole purpose of creating a small server capable of rendering .pug files as well as compiling them to a specified directory. This project will eventually grow to support other file formats and features, but for now it is strictly meant for use with UniversityHigh's editor (https://github.com/UniversityHigh/editor).
